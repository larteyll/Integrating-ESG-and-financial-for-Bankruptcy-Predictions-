Objective
Enhance bankruptcy prediction by integrating ESG metrics with financial data using XGBoost, addressing gaps in traditional models.

Methodology

Data: S&P 500 financial ratios (liquidity, leverage) and ESG scores (governance, controversies).

Techniques: Feature engineering (ESG Profitability, Controversy_Leverage), SMOTE for imbalance, threshold tuning.

Evaluation: F1-score prioritized for imbalanced classes.

Key Findings

ESG improved Low Risk detection (F1: 0.89 vs. 0.85 in financial-only model).

Moderate Risk remained challenging (F1: 0.30).

ESG flagged risks 6â€“12 months earlier.

Recommendation
Adopt hybrid models and advocate for ESG data standardization.
